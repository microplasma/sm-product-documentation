## Ocean Infinity – Survey Management Platform (SMP)

**Version:** 2.1
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** SMP Product Design & Strategy
**Status:** Updated Draft – Workshop-Aligned

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **core product pillars** that guide the Survey Management Platform (SMP) — specifically the two operational priorities identified in the workshop:

1. **Command & Control (C&C)**
2. **Active Monitoring (AM)**

Each pillar integrates validated workshop priorities (short-term and long-term) and reflects the strategic goal of **reducing operational complexity** while enabling **operator-level multi-mission efficiency**.

## 2. Overview of Pillars

| **Pillar**            | **Goal**                                                                            | **Strategic Outcome**                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command & Control** | Simplify and centralize the safe execution of operational commands across missions. | Empower surveyors to manage multiple missions efficiently through automation and role-based control. |
| **Active Monitoring** | Provide real-time, unified awareness of data, sensor health, and mission progress.  | Enhance data integrity, QC consistency, and early anomaly detection across concurrent operations.    |

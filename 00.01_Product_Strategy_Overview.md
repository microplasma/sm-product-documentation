**Owner:** SMP Product Design & Strategy
**Status:** Approved Draft

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **strategic intent** of the Survey Management Platform (SMP) — outlining how Ocean Infinity will achieve its product vision through operational, technological, and experiential strategies.

It connects the SMP’s **mission** (“to unify control, monitoring, and collaboration across survey operations”) with clear **strategic goals**, **pillars**, and **phased priorities** that guide product design and development.

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 Industry Transformation

Marine and offshore survey operations are undergoing rapid digitization.
Traditional on-vessel survey workflows rely on multiple disconnected systems, manual configuration, and human oversight — limiting scalability, consistency, and efficiency.

Ocean Infinity’s operations are increasingly **remote and concurrent**: a single team can now supervise multiple vessels, AUVs, or ROVs from shore.
The SMP is the enabling platform for this model — consolidating fragmented systems into a unified, secure, and collaborative control environment.

### 2.2 The Strategic Opportunity

The shift to remote and autonomous operations demands:

* **Operational resilience:** safe, redundant control of critical systems.
* **Data integrity:** synchronized and traceable mission information.
* **Situational awareness:** unified, real-time view of sensors, assets, and progress.
* **Scalability:** ability to expand from one vessel to a full fleet without adding complexity.

SMP delivers these capabilities as a **mission-centric operating system** — not just a tool, but the backbone of Ocean Infinity’s next-generation operations ecosystem.

## 3. Strategic Objectives

| **Objective**                  | **Goal**                                                             | **Outcome**                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Operational Efficiency**  | Reduce setup and intervention time through automation and templates. | Faster mobilisation and lower vessel idle time.        |
| **2. Situational Awareness**   | Provide unified visibility across systems, missions, and roles.      | Earlier anomaly detection and faster decision-making.  |
| **3. Traceable Collaboration** | Enable concurrent operations with full auditability.                 | Clear accountability, seamless handovers.              |
| **4. Scalability**             | Design for multi-mission, multi-user operation.                      | Fleet-wide coordination and control from any location. |
| **5. Human-Centered Design**   | Reduce cognitive load and interface fragmentation.                   | Confident, intuitive operations at scale.              |

## 4. Strategic Pillars

The SMP strategy is organized around four **product pillars** that translate objectives into design and delivery direction.

| **Pillar**                       | **Focus**                                                                  | **Strategic Intent**                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Command & Control**            | Safe, centralized execution of operational commands.                       | Standardize and automate core actions — start/stop logging, sensor configuration, and control — under a role-aware permission model. |
| **Active Monitoring**            | Real-time visibility of data streams, sensor health, and mission progress. | Replace multi-screen fragmentation with a unified operational view and intelligent alerting.                                         |
| **Collaboration & Traceability** | Concurrent supervision, shared diagnostics, and historical context.        | Introduce multi-user sessions, changelog journals, and handover continuity as first-class features.                                  |
| **Scalability & Resilience**     | Mission virtualization and multi-vessel management.                        | Use modular mission containers and a distributed data model to support parallel operations safely.                                   |

Together, these pillars form the **strategic backbone** of the SMP roadmap.

## 5. Strategic Approach

### 5.1 Design Strategy

* **Role-Based Workspaces:** Interfaces adapt to the user’s function (Surveyor, Supervisor, PEC).
* **Mission-Centric Architecture:** Each mission runs as an isolated workspace — the *Mission Deck* — within a unified environment.
* **Triage-Driven Awareness:** The *Triage Hub* provides cross-mission situational awareness for supervisors.
* **Acknowledge Loop (Ack Loop):** Every action follows a Send → Ack → Working → Done flow for transparency and safety.
* **Cognitive Efficiency:** Prioritize focus through alert severity, contextual highlights, and minimal interface switching.

### 5.2 Technology Strategy

* **Pub/Sub Data Model:** Enables live, non-blocking mission streaming and state synchronization.
* **RBAC Enforcement:** Command authority and view permissions governed by role and session ownership.
* **Diagnostic Automation:** Embedded health checks, signal flow visualization, and rollback features improve uptime.
* **Offline Resilience:** Smart caching ensures continuity during bandwidth interruptions.
* **Open Integration Layer:** Standard APIs connect SMP modules to acquisition and navigation software (e.g., QINSy, EIVA).

### 5.3 Operational Strategy

* **Remote-First Deployment:** Optimized for low-bandwidth, high-reliability remote centers.
* **Incremental Adoption:** Designed for gradual integration alongside existing vessel systems.
* **Template-Driven Setup:** Standardized configuration profiles reduce setup variance.
* **Unified Logging:** All system and manual events captured in a single Online Log, ensuring operational traceability.

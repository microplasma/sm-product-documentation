## Ocean Infinity – Survey Management Platform (SMP)

**Version:** 2.1
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** SMP Product Design & Strategy
**Status:** Updated Draft

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **strategic intent** of the Survey Management Platform (SMP), describing how it delivers operational, technological, and experiential transformation across Ocean Infinity’s survey operations.

It translates SMP’s **vision** (“to unify control, monitoring, and collaboration across survey operations”) into **actionable strategic objectives** and **guiding principles**.

---

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 Industry Transformation

The marine survey industry is shifting from on-vessel operations to distributed, remote, and increasingly autonomous workflows. Ocean Infinity’s operational model requires scalability, efficiency, and resilience to maintain mission throughput with fewer personnel.

SMP is the enabler of this model — consolidating fragmented tools into a coherent environment that supports multi-user and **multi-mission operations at the operator level**.

### 2.2 The Strategic Opportunity

Surveyors currently manage complex toolchains across multiple systems and displays, leading to inefficiency and fatigue. SMP’s strategic opportunity is to:

* **Reduce operational complexity.**
* **Enable surveyors to manage multiple concurrent missions safely and effectively.**
* **Preserve situational awareness** through unified control and monitoring.
* **Allow seamless peer assistance and supervisory support** without interrupting active missions.

## 5. Strategic Approach

### 5.1 Design Strategy

* **Reduced Operational Complexity:** Consolidate essential functions to reduce switching between tools.
* **Role-Based Workspaces:** Interfaces adapt to each user’s function (Operator, Senior, PEC).
* **Multi-Mission Readiness:** Design for safe concurrent mission handling by individual surveyors.
* **Collaborative Assistance:** Enable shared control and supervision without disruption.
* **Cognitive Efficiency:** Focus user attention through triage, priority alerts, and contextual visibility.

### 5.2 Technology Strategy

* **Mission Containerization:** Each mission runs in an isolated workspace with synchronized state.
* **Pub/Sub Data Model:** Live updates and non-blocking synchronization between modules.
* **RBAC Enforcement:** Command and view permissions controlled by roles and session context.
* **Diagnostic Automation:** Health checks and safe rollback capabilities.
* **Interoperability:** Standardized APIs for integration with acquisition, navigation, and telemetry systems.

### 5.3 Operational Strategy

* **Remote-First Model:** Designed for onshore and offshore collaboration.
* **Incremental Adoption:** SMP integrates progressively with existing workflows.
* **Standardization:** Configuration templates and predefined mission profiles reduce variance.
* **Data Integrity:** Automated event logging ensures traceability across missions.

## 6. Roadmap Framework

The following roadmap is **indicative only** and will be validated against **feature prioritization workshops** (Command & Control and Active Monitoring short-/long-term scopes).

| **Phase**                                 | **Focus**                                         | **Indicative Milestones**                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 1 – Core Operations**             | Establish unified mission control and monitoring. | Mission Deck v1, Online Log integration, Sensor Control, QC Dashboard.         |
| **Phase 2 – Collaboration & Concurrency** | Enable multi-user and multi-mission operation.    | Triage Hub, Ack Loop, Config Templates, Operator-level multi-mission sessions. |
| **Phase 3 – Intelligent Operations**      | Introduce automation and predictive diagnostics.  | AI Diagnostics, auto-triage, fleet orchestration.                              |

**Note:** Final roadmap structure will be derived from workshop validation sessions.

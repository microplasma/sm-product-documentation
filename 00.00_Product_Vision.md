## Ocean Infinity – Survey Management Platform (SMP)

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** Product Design & Strategy – SMP Core Team
**Status:** Approved Draft

## 1. Vision Statement

> **The Survey Management Platform (SMP)** enables Ocean Infinity’s teams to manage, monitor, and control complex marine survey operations — across vessels, systems, and missions — from anywhere, with confidence, safety, and efficiency.

The SMP transforms how offshore, onshore, and remote surveyors collaborate.
It replaces fragmented, tool-heavy workflows with a unified, intelligent environment that connects data, sensors, and people through real-time awareness, automation, and role-based control.

---

## 2. Purpose

Modern survey operations span multiple vessels, remote hubs, and autonomous assets.
The SMP is designed to:

* Unify data and operational control across the fleet.
* Reduce cognitive and procedural load on operators.
* Ensure data integrity and operational safety.
* Enable multi-user collaboration and traceable decision-making.
* Scale from single-vessel missions to fully remote, multi-mission environments.

## 3. Strategic Context

### 3.1 Industry Shift

The marine survey industry is moving from **on-vessel operations** to **distributed remote and autonomous systems**.
SMP sits at the center of this transformation — the connective tissue between sensors, platforms, and human oversight.

| Trend                            | SMP Response                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fragmented, multi-tool workflows | Unified modular platform                           |
| Increasing mission concurrency   | Multi-mission “Mission Deck” architecture          |
| Remote collaboration challenges  | Role-based access and control token system         |
| High cognitive load              | Alert-driven design, contextual automation         |
| Manual logging and reporting     | Automated event capture and traceable audit trails |

---

## 4. Product Definition

### 4.1 What SMP Is

A **modular, mission-oriented operating system** for remote and autonomous survey operations.
Each mission is represented as a live, virtual workspace — the **Mission Deck** — where operators can view, control, and collaborate in real time.

### 4.2 What SMP Is Not

* It is **not** a replacement for acquisition software (e.g., QINSy, EIVA).
* It is **not** a reporting platform — though it feeds report generation.
* It does **not** store raw survey data long-term — it monitors, validates, and synchronizes operational data.

### 4.3 SMP’s Core Role

> **To orchestrate people, systems, and data across the survey lifecycle — from mobilisation to reporting — through control, visibility, and automation.**

## 5. Core Vision Pillars

| **Pillar**                       | **Purpose**                                                                                   | **Outcome**                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command & Control**            | Provide operators with safe, centralized authority over sensors, logging, and configurations. | Rapid, traceable, role-based control; fewer manual interventions.      |
| **Active Monitoring**            | Deliver unified visibility across all live data streams, system health, and QC indicators.    | Real-time awareness; early anomaly detection; consistent data quality. |
| **Collaboration & Traceability** | Enable concurrent supervision and shared diagnostics without interference.                    | Multi-user workflows, session history, and auditable change logs.      |
| **Scalability & Resilience**     | Support mission concurrency and distributed operations.                                       | Fleet-level visibility and fault-tolerant data flow.                   |

## 6. Guiding Design Principles

| **Principle**                  | **Description**                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unified Context**            | All key operational information accessible in one interface, organized by mission.        |
| **Non-Blocking Collaboration** | Multiple users can observe or act simultaneously without interrupting acquisition.        |
| **Acknowledged Control**       | Every command follows a Send → Ack → Working → Done feedback loop for clarity and safety. |
| **Adaptive Awareness**         | Alerts and dashboards focus attention only where needed; cognitive load is minimized.     |
| **Role-Based Trust**           | Access and editing rights reflect operational hierarchy and accountability.               |
| **System Memory**              | Every change, configuration, and event is recorded, timestamped, and recoverable.         |

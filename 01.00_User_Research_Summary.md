## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document consolidates user research for SMP. It summarizes **who our users are**, **how they work** (operations, tasks, and tools), **their pain points**, and **opportunity areas** that inform product pillars and feature design.

Derived from validated internal studies, operational data, and workshop results.

---

## 2. Methods & Sources (Evidence Base)

- Multi-role interviews and observational sessions (Surveyor, Senior Surveyor, PEC, IT).
- Operational-workflow transcription and cross-system tool audits.
- Workshop on pain points and feature priorities.
- Quantitative task–tool datasets (new integration 2025-10-25).

Primary sources: `OI_SMP_Full_UX_Research.md`, `Operational_Workflows.md`, `OperationTypesWorkflows.md`, `Surveyor_Tasks.csv`, `Workshop_workflow_map-features-pain.xlsx`, `Underwater Survey Operations – Task Structure`, `DLog 241025 SMP Direction Update.md`.

## 3. Participants & Roles (Operational Ecosystem)

| Role | Core Responsibilities | Typical Decisions / Authority | Top Pain Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Surveyor (Operator)** | Operate and monitor sensors; real-time QC and logging. | Start/stop logging; minor config; line selection. | Fragmented tool use, manual logging checks, limited remote control. |
| **Senior Surveyor** | Supervise execution, perform calibrations, ensure spec compliance. | Approve critical settings; handle mobilisation and troubleshooting. | Manual MAC and daily reports; no central diagnostics. |
| **PEC / Supervisor** | Coordinate missions, reallocate vessels or teams, client communication. | Prioritise operations, review data delivery timelines. | Limited multi-mission visibility and handover traceability. |
| **IT Support** | Network access, whitelisting, security approval. | Port rules and MAC/IP management. | Ticketing delays impact mobilisation readiness. |

## 4. Operation Types & Contexts

| Operation Type | Purpose / Characteristics | Equipment & Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pipeline / Cable Inspection (IMR)** | Highly visual and decision-heavy; requires precise orientation and rapid QC. | ROV + HD video, MBES/SSS, QINSy NAV Display, Online Log, OneNote for handover. |
| **Geophysical** | Fast coverage of large areas with remote instruments. | Discover SSS, Inomar SBP, SIS MBES, Rovins INS, QINSy / EIVA / APOS. |
| **Geotechnical** | Slow, sampling-intensive operations with frequent waiting and manual annotation. | CPT / Vibrocorer, QINSy, EIVA, APOS, manual Redgate logging. |

## 5. Operational Phases & High-Level Workflows

**Typical phases:** Project Startup → Planning → Mobilisation → Calibration → Operation → Shift Handover → Reporting.

Key friction themes: network whitelisting, multi-tool integration, manual reporting, bandwidth limits for remote ops.

## 6. Tasks & Tool Usage (Expanded Dataset 2025-10-25)

| Operation Type | Role | Task Type | Task | Tool / Software Used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Geo / Pipeline | Surveyor | Navigation | Check which survey line is running | QINSy Quantum (GPS navigation) | Routine start-of-shift check for context. |
| Geotechnical | Surveyor | Navigation | Position vessel for CPT or Vibrocore deployment | QINSy Quantum | Precise position required per client spec. |
| Geotechnical | Surveyor | Navigation | Move to next planned sampling point | QINSy Quantum | Task sequencing after core recovery. |
| Pipeline Inspection | Surveyor | Navigation | Check infrastructure and exclusion zones | Background data in QINSy Display | Avoid collision with ROV equipment. |
| Pipeline Inspection | Surveyor | Navigation | Check current KP (Kilometer Point) reference | QINSy | Maintains alignment and traceability. |

| Pipeline Inspection | PEC / Senior Surveyor | Navigation | Reposition vessel when time limit reached | QINSy planning + situational view | Prevent idle vessel time. |
| Geo / Pipeline | Surveyor | Data Logging & Validation | Verify parameters logged per project manual | Redgate (local file structure) | Manual folder inspection even if status green. |
| Geotechnical | Surveyor | Data Logging & Validation | Set up extra log files as requested | Redgate folders | Client/offline team customization. |
| Pipeline Inspection | Surveyor | Data Logging & Validation | Confirm video overlay accuracy (KP, pipe name, node) | VOYIS / RVHD cams / QINSy / Windy | Ensures synchronized metadata. |
| Pipeline Inspection (IMR) | 3.4U Inspector | Data Logging & Validation | Perform visual inspection and video logging | VOYIS / RVHD cams | Visual confirmation of asset condition. |
| Geo / Pipeline | Surveyor | Data Logging & Validation | Maintain online log of vessel and survey activities | Online Log | Primary timeline of events. |
| Pipeline Inspection | Surveyor | Data Logging & Validation | Comment on pipe abnormalities linked to position | Online Log | Geospatially referenced annotations. |

## 7. Pain Points (Synthesised)

- **Tool Fragmentation** — Operators use >8 applications per mission; no unified state view.
- **Manual Logging and Verification** — Redundant folder checks and manual QC of green indicators.
- **Handover Consistency** — Online Log vs OneNote dual systems create gaps.
- **Role Overlap** — Senior Surveyor re-checks tasks done by Surveyor due to trust gaps in systems.
- **Remote Ops Latency** — Bandwidth and RDP performance limit real-time collaboration.

## 8. Opportunity Themes (Mapped to Pillars)

| Theme | Pillar → Module | Opportunity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unified Control and Safety** | C&C → Sensor Control, Configuration Manager | Aggregate ON/OFF/Restart and logging commands with role-based ack loops. |
| **Active Monitoring and QC** | AM → Output Monitoring, Diagnostics & Health | Live multi-sensor views, thresholds, auto-validation of parameters. |
| **Traceability and Auditability** | Cross → Online Log, File Monitoring | Auto-log commands + events for seamless handover. |
| **Collaborative Operations** | Cross → RBAC & Collaboration | Supervisors join sessions without interrupting others. |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Platform → Mission Deck / Triage Hub | Enable multi-mission operation (2-4 missions per operator). |

---

## 9. Implications for SMP Strategy

- **Reduce tool count** and centralize control and QC tasks within SMP.
- **Design for multi-mission workspaces** and triage management.
- **Automate log consistency checks** and system traceability.
- **Support remote assist and session sharing** natively.

## 10. Open Questions / Data Needs

1. Final role taxonomy confirmation (Survey Assistant? Client Rep?).
2. Quantitative benchmarks for missions per operator and alert tolerance.
3. Upstream integration scope (DP, weather feeds).
4. Remote ops bandwidth thresholds for multi-stream viewing.

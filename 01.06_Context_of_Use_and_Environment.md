## Ocean Infinity – Survey Management Platform (SMP)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** SMP Research & Design
**Status:** Complete (Operational Environment Overview)

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the **context of use** for the Survey Management Platform (SMP) — the physical, technical, and cognitive environment in which offshore and remote survey operations occur.

It describes constraints, environmental conditions, and collaboration patterns that directly influence the platform’s design decisions.

The goal is to ensure SMP is built with an **accurate understanding of user conditions**, enabling effective, resilient, and safe operations both offshore and onshore.

## 2. Methodology & Sources

Synthesized from field observations, interviews, and documentation, including:

* `2.2.Survey current state Deck.md`
* `2.3.OI_Operational_Workflows.md`
* `2.3.1.OperationTypesWorkflows.md`
* `DLog_241025_smp_direction_update.md`
* `Underwater Survey Operations – Task Structure`

Cross-validated with operational feedback from online and offshore teams between 2023–2025.

## 3. Operational Environments

### 3.1 Offshore Control Room

* **Setup:** Typically 6–8 screens per operator, distributed across multiple systems (navigation, sensor monitoring, ROV video, logging, communication).
* **Lighting & Conditions:** Dimmed environment with limited natural light, requiring strong visual contrast and low-glare interfaces.
* **Noise & Vibration:** Constant low-frequency background noise from vessel machinery; communication via headsets and intercom.
* **Workload Characteristics:** Long shifts (12-hour rotations), alternating focus between active control and passive monitoring.
* **Cognitive Constraints:** High mental load due to multi-system vigilance and alarm fatigue.

### 3.2 Remote Operations Centre (ROC)

* **Setup:** Fewer screens per user (4–6 typical), higher bandwidth reliability, and better ergonomic setup.
* **Role Distribution:** One senior may supervise multiple missions concurrently.
* **Collaboration Mode:** Real-time remote assistance via chat/video overlay, shared mission dashboards.
* **Challenge:** Latency in command feedback or data visualization may cause delayed responses during troubleshooting.

### 3.3 Vessel Deck & Equipment Zone

* **Setup:** Mobile tablets or terminals used for calibration and deck activity coordination.
* **Environmental Factors:** Wet, cold, or variable light conditions; gloves, movement, and PPE affect usability.
* **Design Relevance:** Mobile or touchscreen interfaces must use large targets, minimal text input, and offline cache capabilities.

## 4. Human and Organizational Context

| **Aspect**                  | **Description**                                                 | **SMP Design Consideration**                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shift Patterns**          | 12-hour rotations; frequent handovers with in-person briefings. | Persistent logs and handover snapshots.                       |
| **Roles per Mission**       | 1–2 Surveyors, 1 Senior, 1 PEC (shared across missions).        | Multi-user concurrent sessions with hierarchical permissions. |
| **Communication Channels**  | Intercom, OneNote, Online Log, chat apps.                       | Integrate key notes and events into central SMP log.          |
| **Error Tolerance**         | High operational consequence for data loss or misalignment.     | Require confirmations, rollback, and visible action trails.   |
| **Collaboration Pattern**   | Supervisor assists operators without taking control.            | Observation and assist mode design.                           |
| **Attention Distribution**  | 70% monitoring, 30% control action.                             | Prioritize visibility and early-warning systems.              |
| **Fatigue & Handover Risk** | High risk of detail loss at shift changes.                      | Standardized event templates and context snapshots.           |

## 5. Technical Environment

| **Domain**                | **Details / Constraints**                                                                   | **Design Implication**                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**               | Variable reliability; offshore vessels experience intermittent latency (100–300ms typical). | Resilient UI updates; auto-reconnect for sensor feeds.           |
| **Data Volume**           | High-volume streams (video, sonar, navigation).                                             | Progressive loading and adaptive compression.                    |
| **Hardware Diversity**    | Mix of ruggedized PCs, laptops, and workstations with varying GPU/CPU capacity.             | Modular UI with dynamic scaling.                                 |
| **Integration Landscape** | Proprietary hardware (EIVA, SIS, QINSy, VOYIS, APOS).                                       | Develop middleware or API gateways for data harmonization.       |
| **Logging Systems**       | Local folder structures (“Red Network”), shared drives, Online Log.                         | Integrate logging verification and automated consistency checks. |

## 6. Cognitive and Interaction Context

| **Dimension**           | **Observed Behavior / Condition**                                                       | **Design Principle**                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attention Span**      | Operators maintain multiple parallel attention threads (sensor, navigation, ROV, logs). | Reduce alarm noise; surface priority alerts only.                 |
| **Trust in Automation** | Users rely on visual confirmation, not automated validation.                            | Make automation visible and verifiable (“verified by system”).    |
| **System Navigation**   | Users prefer persistent screen layouts and minimal context switching.                   | Fixed panel layout, non-modal workflows.                          |
| **Error Recovery**      | Users fear irreversible actions.                                                        | Undo/rollback and confirmation dialogues on all critical actions. |
| **Learning Curve**      | Operators vary in experience across vessels and project types.                          | Use progressive disclosure and standardized templates.            |
| **Collaboration Style** | Real-time verbal communication remains dominant.                                        | SMP notifications should mirror verbal status cues.               |

## 7. Design Implications Summary

1. **Design for visibility and feedback** – users must always see what is happening and why.
2. **Resilient interaction model** – platform must sustain partial data loss or temporary disconnections.
3. **Standardize across contexts** – interfaces should look and behave consistently across offshore and remote settings.
4. **Minimize manual data handling** – reduce folder management and manual log entry.
5. **Integrate human rhythms** – support shift transitions and fatigue mitigation through structured overviews.
6. **Accessible and ergonomic** – support both mouse/keyboard and touch under varying lighting and motion conditions.

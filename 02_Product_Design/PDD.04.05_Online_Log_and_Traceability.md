# PDD.04.05_Online_Log_and_Traceability

## Purpose
The **Online Log** is the unified event and annotation system for the Survey Management Platform (SMP).  
It records, displays, and manages all system and operator events related to mission operations—ensuring traceability, accountability, and consistent communication across shifts, missions, and remote teams.

The Online Log provides both **automatic event logging** (system-level) and **manual input** (operator notes), serving as the authoritative mission timeline.

---

## Scope & Context
The Online Log operates at the **Global Layer** of the SMP, maintaining visibility across all missions.  
It can filter to display entries from:
- **All Missions** (global awareness)
- **Active Mission** (contextual focus)
- **Specific Mission** (on demand)

It is accessible as:
- A persistent **bottom dock** on the Mission Deck.  
- A **dedicated window** in the full SMP screen configuration (Screen 8).

## Key Concepts / Framework

| Concept | Description | Role |
|----------|--------------|------|
| **System Event** | Automatically generated entry from any SMP component (Mission Deck, Stream Viewer, Config Manager). | Provides traceability of state changes. |
| **Operator Entry** | Manual annotation or observation added by the surveyor. | Records human input or situational notes. |
| **Contextual Filtering** | Allows filtering by mission, type, or source. | Focuses operator attention on relevant information. |
| **Cross-Linking** | Entries link back to related components or actions. | Enables contextual navigation. |
| **Shift Summary** | Exportable view of log entries for defined time range. | Supports handovers and audit records. |

---

## Functional or UX Details

### 1. Layout Overview

| Zone | Purpose | Components |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Header Bar** | Provides context and filtering controls. | Mission selector (All / Active / Specific), event type filters, search bar. |
| **Log Stream** | Displays real-time entries in chronological order. | Timestamp, mission, source, description, author. |
| **Entry Input Bar** | Enables manual or quick operator entries. | Text input field, quick entry buttons, tag selector. |
| **Footer** | Provides export and navigation options. | Time filter (e.g., last 6h), “Export Summary” button. |

---

### 2. Entry Types

| Type | Source | Description | Example |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **System** | SMP Core | Automatic event log generated by Mission Deck, Stream Viewer, Diagnostics, or Config Manager. | “Logging started on MBES.” |
| **Alert / Warning** | Health & Quality | Logged when threshold exceeded or sensor alert triggered. | “High latency detected on GNSS feed.” |
| **Configuration** | Config Manager | Recorded when templates applied or parameters updated. | “Applied template: ShallowWater_Std.” |
| **Operator Note** | Manual Input | Surveyor observation or situational note. | “SVP profile updated; improved SNR.” |
| **Mission Event** | Mission Context | Mission-level actions or transitions. | “Mission state changed: Preparation → Active.” |

---

### 3. Filters & Search

- **Mission Filter:**  
  - *All Missions* – shows full log across SMP.  
  - *Active Mission Only* – shows entries related to the currently selected mission.  
  - *Specific Mission* – allows user to choose any mission ID.  
- **Type Filter:** Show/hide System, Alerts, Configuration, or Operator entries.  
- **Text Search:** Keyword or tag-based.  
- **Time Filter:** Restrict by time window (e.g., “Last 6 hours,” “Last 24 hours”).  

> Filtering does not alter log history — it changes only the visible subset.

---

### 4. Quick Entry (Operator Logging)

| Feature | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Quick Note Field** | Text input for free-form comments. | One-line or multiline; timestamped on entry. |
| **Tag Selector** | Assigns category tags (e.g., “Calibration,” “QC,” “Network”). | Optional; color-coded. |
| **Predefined Buttons** | One-click templates for frequent notes. | “SVP updated,” “Sensor restarted,” “QC check complete.” |
| **Attribution** | All manual entries include user and UTC timestamp. | Auto-inserted by system. |

> Quick Entry allows the operator to capture events rapidly without interrupting workflow.

---

### 5. Cross-Linking & Traceability

Each log entry includes **source metadata**, allowing contextual navigation:
- Clicking an entry opens the related component (e.g., Configuration Manager → relevant sensor).
- Cross-references include:
  - Mission ID
  - Source Module (Deck, Viewer, Config, etc.)
  - Event Type (System / Operator / Alert)

All entries are stored chronologically and immutable after recording.

---

### 6. Export & Handover

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Export Summary** | Generates report for specified time window or event type. | Outputs in CSV or PDF. |
| **Handover Mode** | Predefined export presets for shift changes (e.g., 6-hour interval). | Auto-filters entries by mission and time. |
| **Archive View** | Read-only mode for completed missions. | Locked once mission ends; accessible via Triage Hub. |

All exports are tagged with UTC timestamps and author metadata.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Online Log aggregates all mission and system events in real time.  
- Filtering supports *All Missions*, *Active Mission*, and *Specific Mission* contexts.  
- Quick Entry enables surveyors to capture notes efficiently.  
- All entries are timestamped, attributed, and immutable post-record.  
- Logs support filtering by type, mission, and time.  
- Exports generate readable summaries for handovers or archives.  
- Layout remains responsive across Mission Deck dock and standalone window.

## Open Questions & Next Steps

| Topic | Pending Decision |
|--------|------------------|
| **Tag Library Definition** | Define standard tag set for quick entry. |
| **Cross-Link Scope** | Decide which modules support deep linking from log entries. |
| **Collaboration Features** | Assess feasibility of real-time shared editing (multi-operator). |
| **Alert Integration Depth** | Determine if critical alerts should trigger automatic log scroll or highlight. |
| **Data Retention Policy** | Define how long mission logs are stored and where archived. |

---

### Summary Statement

> The **Online Log** acts as the SMP’s unified event and annotation system—capturing every mission activity in real time and providing operators with an auditable, searchable, and exportable record.  
> Through contextual filtering, quick entry, and consistent synchronization across the platform, it ensures clarity, accountability, and operational traceability throughout multi-mission operations.

## Ocean Infinity – Survey Management Platform (SMP)

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** SMP Product Design & Strategy
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **core product pillars** that guide the Survey Management Platform (SMP) — specifically the two operational priorities that drive product design and development:

1. **Command & Control (C&C)**
2. **Active Monitoring (AM)**

Each pillar is articulated through its **vision**, **key capabilities**, **short-term and long-term priorities**, and **measurable outcomes**.
Together, they express how SMP reduces operational complexity, supports multi-mission concurrency, and improves efficiency across Ocean Infinity’s survey operations.

## 2. Overview of Pillars

| **Pillar**            | **Goal**                                                                            | **Strategic Outcome**                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command & Control** | Simplify and centralize the safe execution of operational commands across missions. | Enable surveyors to manage multiple missions efficiently through automation and role-based control. |
| **Active Monitoring** | Provide real-time, unified awareness of data, sensor health, and mission progress.  | Enhance data integrity, QC consistency, and early anomaly detection across concurrent operations.   |

These two pillars form the **operational foundation** of SMP.
They are closely interconnected — C&C ensures reliable action, while AM ensures visibility, context, and trust in system state.

## 3. Pillar 1 – Command & Control (C&C)

### 3.1 Vision

To enable safe, centralized, and efficient execution of mission control actions across all connected systems and sensors — allowing a single operator to perform coordinated, traceable operations over multiple concurrent missions.

---

### 3.2 Design Intent

* **Reduce interaction complexity:** eliminate repetitive manual steps (e.g., RDP access, multi-tool control).
* **Standardize control flows:** define clear, role-based command processes with acknowledgement feedback loops.
* **Ensure operational safety:** maintain control separation between missions while enabling quick intervention.
* **Enable collaboration:** allow supervisors and peers to assist without interrupting live mission control.

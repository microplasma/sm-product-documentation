## Ocean Infinity – Survey Management Platform (SMP)

**Version:** 2.1
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** Product Design & Strategy – SMP Core Team
**Status:** Updated Draft

## 1. Vision Statement

> **The Survey Management Platform (SMP)** enables Ocean Infinity’s teams to manage, monitor, and control complex marine survey operations — across vessels, systems, and missions — from anywhere, with confidence, safety, and efficiency.

SMP transforms how offshore, onshore, and remote surveyors collaborate. It replaces fragmented, tool-heavy workflows with a unified, intelligent environment that connects data, sensors, and people through real-time awareness, automation, and **safe multi-mission operations**.

---

## 2. Purpose

Modern survey operations span multiple vessels, remote hubs, and autonomous assets.
The SMP is designed to:

* Unify data and operational control across the fleet.
* Reduce cognitive and procedural load on operators.
* Ensure data integrity and operational safety.
* Enable **surveyors to manage multiple missions simultaneously**.
* Scale from single-vessel operations to fully remote, multi-mission environments.

---

## 3. Strategic Context

Marine survey operations are transitioning from vessel-based execution to distributed, remote, and autonomous control models.
SMP sits at the center of this transformation — **reducing operational complexity while enabling multi-mission oversight by individual operators**.

| Trend                                       | SMP Response                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fragmented workflows and high operator load | Unified modular platform with automated context management |
| Increasing mission concurrency              | Operator-level multi-mission capability                    |
| Remote collaboration challenges             | Role-based access and shared assistance workflows          |
| Manual logging and QC overhead              | Automated logging and live event traceability              |

## 4. Product Definition

### 4.1 What SMP Is

A **mission-oriented operating system** for remote and autonomous survey operations, designed to unify control, monitoring, and collaboration.

### 4.2 What SMP Is Not

* Not a replacement for acquisition or navigation software.
* Not a reporting platform, though it feeds report generation.
* Not a long-term data repository — it synchronizes and validates operational data in real time.

### 4.3 Core Role

> **To orchestrate people, systems, and data across the survey lifecycle — through control, visibility, and automation.**

## 5. Core Vision Pillars

| **Pillar**                       | **Purpose**                                                        | **Outcome**                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command & Control**            | Centralized, safe execution of survey operations.                  | Reduced manual intervention and faster setup.         |
| **Active Monitoring**            | Unified awareness of data, sensors, and system health.             | Early anomaly detection and improved data quality.    |
| **Collaboration & Traceability** | Seamless teamwork with full visibility of actions.                 | Fewer interruptions, easier handovers.                |
| **Scalability & Resilience**     | **Operator-level mission concurrency** and distributed operations. | Maintain operational throughput with fewer personnel. |

## 6. Guiding Design Principles

| **Principle**                  | **Description**                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unified Context**            | All critical mission data is accessible in one environment.              |
| **Non-Blocking Collaboration** | Users can assist or supervise without disrupting active operations.      |
| **Acknowledged Control**       | All commands follow a clear feedback loop (Send → Ack → Working → Done). |
| **Reduced Complexity**         | Consolidated interfaces simplify control and awareness across missions.  |
| **Role-Based Trust**           | Permissions ensure safe command authority and auditability.              |
| **System Memory**              | Every change, configuration, and event is recorded and restorable.       |

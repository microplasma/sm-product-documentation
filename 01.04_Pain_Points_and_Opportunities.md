## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document consolidates pain points identified across research, workflow analyses, and workshops, translating them into **strategic opportunity areas** for the Survey Management Platform (SMP).

It complements `01.03_Tasks_and_Tools_Matrix.md` by organizing findings into clusters that reflect operational stages and align with SMP‚Äôs **core product pillars** ‚Äî **Command & Control (C&C)**, **Active Monitoring (AM)**, **Online Log & Traceability**, and **Collaboration & Multi-Mission Enablement**.

## 2. Methodology & Sources

Derived from cross-analysis of:

* `01.03_Tasks_and_Tools_Matrix.md`
* `Workshop_workflow_map-features-pain.xlsx`
* `2.1.OI_SMP_Full_UX_Research.md`
* `2.3.OI_Operational_Workflows.md`
* `Underwater Survey Operations ‚Äì Task Structure`
* `Surveyor_Tasks.csv`

Pain points were categorized according to operational phase, user role, and system dependency. Opportunities were mapped based on feature alignment and design feasibility.

## 7. Strategic Design Implications

1. **SMP as the single operational environment:** unify fragmented tool landscape into a cohesive workspace.
2. **Shift from reactive QC to proactive health monitoring:** embed diagnostics, auto-thresholds, and alerts.
3. **Enable operator efficiency scaling:** through automation, template-driven configuration, and multi-mission support.
4. **Institutionalize traceability:** every event, action, and change is auto-logged with role attribution.
5. **Reduce cognitive load:** use role-based visibility layers and simplified alert hierarchies.

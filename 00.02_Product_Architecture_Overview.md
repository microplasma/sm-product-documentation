## 2. Architectural Principles

| **Principle**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modularity**                    | Each SMP capability exists as an independent module. Modules can evolve or be replaced without redesigning the entire system.                                                                                        |
| **Mission-Centric Design**        | Operations revolve around "missions" — virtualized representations of ongoing surveys. Every action, log, and configuration is contextualized within a mission workspace.                                            |
| **Reduced Complexity**            | SMP simplifies operators’ interaction with complex systems by integrating key workflows, minimizing tool-switching, and ensuring consistency across functions.                                                       |
| **Concurrent Mission Operations** | Individual surveyors can safely manage, monitor, and control multiple active missions at once. The system dynamically manages focus, alerts, and data synchronization to preserve operational safety and efficiency. |
| **Distributed Collaboration**     | Multiple users (onboard, onshore, remote) can safely observe, assist, or command without conflict. Access and actions are governed by role-based permissions.                                                        |
| **Traceable State Management**    | All actions, configurations, and events are automatically recorded — forming a continuous operational record.                                                                                                        |
| **Scalable Architecture**         | The system expands from single-vessel control to multi-mission fleet operations through modular orchestration and scalable data management.                                                                          |
| **Interoperability**              | SMP connects seamlessly with acquisition, navigation, and IT systems through defined data and API interfaces.                                                                                                        |

## 3. Conceptual Overview

SMP functions as an **orchestration layer** connecting people, systems, and data across multiple concurrent survey missions. It reduces operational complexity while ensuring every mission remains contextually distinct, safe, and traceable.

The architecture enables:

* Simultaneous mission sessions per operator.
* Synchronized data and alerts across missions.
* Context preservation when switching between missions.
* Peer or supervisor assistance without workflow disruption.

---

## 4. Core System Concepts

### 4.1 Mission Deck

The **Mission Deck** is the operator’s live workspace environment. Each operator can run multiple mission decks in parallel, switching between them seamlessly.

* Each deck represents a single mission context: controls, logs, and monitoring views.
* Operators can manage several missions concurrently within the same interface session.
* Alerts and task queues dynamically triage focus between missions.
* Assistance from peers or seniors can be initiated contextually (view-only or shared control modes).
* Each mission deck maintains independent command safety and data isolation.

**Outcome:** One operator can maintain operational volume previously requiring multiple personnel.

---

### 4.2 Triage Hub

The **Triage Hub** enables situational overview and support across active missions:

* Aggregates mission states, alerts, and health scores.
* Provides real-time prioritization of missions needing attention.
* Allows supervisors or peers to assist in a mission temporarily without interrupting others.
* Forms the backbone for distributed operations and workload balancing.

---

### 4.3 Online Log

The **Online Log** captures every system and user event across all active missions:

* Consolidates mission event data in real time.
* Maintains a single source of truth for operational review, audit, and handover.
* Supports mission switching without losing event continuity.
* Enables traceability across parallel operations.

---

## 5. Module Architecture

Each SMP **module** is independent but interoperable across missions.
Modules subscribe to mission contexts and can operate concurrently for multiple missions within the same user session.

| **Module**                      | **Primary Purpose**                                                      | **Multi-Mission Role**                                                                                                 |

## 6. Data and State Management

SMP maintains **live, synchronized mission states** across multiple concurrent sessions using a publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub) architecture.

| **Function**                   | **Description**                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mission Context Containers** | Each mission operates in its own isolated container, with state synchronized to subscribed modules. |
| **Multi-Context State Engine** | Operators can maintain multiple mission states concurrently without conflict or data loss.          |
| **Event Logging**              | All mission actions and state transitions are captured with timestamps and user attribution.        |
| **Resilient Synchronization**  | Network or bandwidth interruptions trigger local caching and auto-reconciliation once reconnected.  |
| **Cross-Mission Event Bus**    | Centralized event routing enables prioritization, triage, and alert focus across missions.          |

---

## 7. Collaboration and Access Control

The collaboration framework supports **safe, shared operations** between surveyors and supervisors across multiple active missions.

* **Role-Based Access (RBAC):** Defines authority levels for command, view, and assistance.
* **Session Sharing:** Another surveyor or senior can join a mission context without seizing control.
* **Acknowledgement Loop:** All control actions follow Send → Ack → Working → Done confirmation.
* **Focus Retention:** User interface surfaces only relevant missions or alerts requiring attention.

| **Role**                | **Capabilities**                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surveyor / Operator** | Manage multiple missions simultaneously, execute commands, monitor QC and alerts.   |
| **Senior Surveyor**     | Oversee and support surveyors, assist on-demand without disrupting mission control. |
| **PEC / Supervisor**    | Triage and allocate missions, monitor overall system health.                        |
| **System Admin**        | Manage configuration, RBAC permissions, and integrations.                           |

---

## 8. Integration Model

SMP integrates with existing acquisition, navigation, and IT systems.
All integrations are abstracted through a **unified API Gateway**, supporting simultaneous mission data exchange.

* **Upstream Systems:** Sensor data acquisition, navigation, positioning, telemetry.
* **Downstream Systems:** Log archives, QA pipelines, performance reporting.
* **Inter-Mission Interfaces:** Data sharing, diagnostic sync, and template distribution.

---

## 9. Scalability Framework

SMP scales **horizontally across missions and operators**.

| **Level**          | **Scaling Function**                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operator-Level** | Multiple concurrent mission contexts per user session.                              |
| **Mission-Level**  | Independent mission containers executed in parallel.                                |
| **Fleet-Level**    | Aggregation of mission health, data, and alerts across all active operations.       |
| **System-Level**   | Load-balanced service architecture distributing mission orchestration across nodes. |

This architecture supports the operational goal of maintaining output volume with fewer personnel — enabling higher efficiency per operator while preserving safety and control integrity.

---

## 10. Security and Compliance Principles

* **RBAC Enforcement:** Role-based authentication for all commands and session joins.
* **Audit Trail:** Immutable logging of all control and mission events.
* **Fail-Safe Commands:** Validation of all actions before execution.
* **Secure Communications:** Encrypted mission data channels.
* **Data Integrity:** Automated verification during sync and rollback.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document provides a **comprehensive matrix** connecting operational tasks, tools, and user roles across the three primary survey operation types — **Geophysical**, **Geotechnical**, and **Pipeline / IMR**.

It identifies how current workflows function, where pain points occur, and highlights the **strategic opportunities for the Survey Management Platform (SMP)** to improve efficiency, safety, and collaboration.

This file serves as the factual and analytical backbone linking **User Research**, **Operational Workflows**, and **Feature Framework** design.

## 5. Insights Summary

**Top Pain Point Categories:**

1. **Tool Fragmentation:** Operators use 8–12 separate applications per mission.
2. **Manual Verification:** Data integrity checks require folder-level inspection.
3. **Redundant Logging:** Online Log, OneNote, and manual reports duplicate information.
4. **Lack of Standardization:** No consistent thresholds or templates across operation types.
5. **Limited Visibility:** Supervisors lack a live mission overview.

**Key SMP Opportunities:**

* Consolidate navigation, QC, and logging interfaces.
* Automate event recording and file verification.
* Standardize configuration templates across operations.
* Provide multi-role access with assist modes.
* Enable live mission progress and QC dashboards.

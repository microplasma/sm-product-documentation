# 04.02_Mission_Deck

## Purpose
The **Mission Deck** is the primary operational surface of the Survey Management Platform (SMP).  
It serves as the central workspace where surveyors manage live survey missions—executing mission-level commands, monitoring system and sensor health, and responding to alerts.

The Mission Deck integrates control, monitoring, and traceability in a single mission-context view, enabling **safe, efficient, and transparent command execution** from onshore operational facilities.

---

## Scope & Context
The Mission Deck belongs to the **Mission Layer** of the SMP and operates within the currently active mission context.  
It is the main control interface used by **Survey Operators** and **Senior Surveyors** to manage live offshore data acquisition systems.

Functions include:
- Starting and stopping data logging.  
- Monitoring health, quality, and performance metrics.  
- Managing mission alerts and sensor statuses.  
- Launching configuration or diagnostic modals.  
- Reviewing mission-specific logs.  

Diagnostics and Configuration tools are **accessed via modals** within this screen, preserving mission context and avoiding interface switching.

## Key Concepts / Framework

### 1. Conceptual Overview

The Mission Deck brings together four essential control dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Role |
|------------|--------------|------|
| **Command & Execution** | Allows operators to control mission logging and essential functions. | Mission management and safety. |
| **Health & Quality Monitoring** | Displays system, sensor, and data quality metrics in real time. | Early detection of performance degradation. |
| **Alert & Event Awareness** | Highlights operational and data quality alerts requiring attention. | Supports timely operator response. |
| **Traceability & Feedback** | Automatically logs all actions and events for accountability. | Provides audit trail for all mission activity. |

The interface is designed for **continuous situational awareness**, enabling operators to balance automation with manual oversight.

## Functional or UX Details

### 2. Layout Overview

| Zone | Purpose | Key Components |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Header** | Provides global mission context. | Mission name & ID, vessel, UTC clock, health indicator. |
| **Left Panel – Command Center** | Primary mission controls and tool access. | Start/Stop logging, Apply Template, Pre-check, Config & Diagnostics buttons. |
| **Center Panel – Health & Quality** | Displays live operational metrics for system and sensors. | Metric tiles, trend indicators, summary gauges. |
| **Right Panel – Alerts & Notifications** | Lists real-time alerts with severity and state. | Alert stack, acknowledge buttons, suggested actions. |
| **Bottom Dock – Online Log** | Shows mission-specific recent log entries. | Chronological events, filters, add note option. |

The layout follows a **left-to-right, top-to-bottom operational rhythm**, minimizing visual search effort and maintaining predictable control zones.

---

### 3. Command Center

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Start Logging** | Begins live data recording. | Requires single-click confirmation; visible progress indication. |
| **Stop Logging** | Halts data recording safely. | Confirmation required to prevent accidental interruption. |
| **Run Pre-Check** | Performs system readiness validation (sensors, configurations). | Displays modal with results summary. |
| **Apply Template** | Loads predefined configuration template for current mission. | Confirmation modal; results logged. |
| **Open Diagnostics** | Opens diagnostics modal (signal flow, subsystem check). | Context-specific modal overlay. |
| **Open Config Manager** | Opens configuration modal for review or modification. | Displays active sensor configurations. |

> All commands generate automatic log entries for traceability.  
> Destructive or data-impacting actions (like Stop Logging) require explicit confirmation.

### 4. Health & Quality Monitoring

This section provides **at-a-glance visibility** into system and sensor status.  
It combines data from multiple subsystems into aggregated mission health indicators.

| Metric Group | Example Metrics | Representation | Source |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **System Health** | CPU Load, Latency, Network Throughput | Bar or gauge with thresholds (color + icon). | Mission System Engine |
| **Sensor Health** | SNR, Ping Density, INS Drift, GNSS HDOP | Numeric tiles with trend arrows. | Sensor Telemetry |
| **Data Quality** | File Rate, Data Completeness, Packet Loss | Percentage bars or small charts. | Logging Subsystem |
| **Environmental** | SVP Age, Depth Range, Motion RMS | Compact metrics with color states. | Sensor Suite |
| **Overall Health Index** | Aggregated state combining multiple metrics. | Color-coded summary badge (✓ / ! / ⚠). | Calculated |

Metrics refresh continuously during mission runtime.  
Critical metrics may trigger **actionable alerts** with contextual guidance (“Check transducer alignment,” “Network packet loss rising”).

---

### 5. Alerts & Notifications

| Element | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Alert Stack** | Vertical list of current alerts ordered by severity and recency. | Always visible on right panel. |
| **Severity Colors** | Red = critical, Amber = warning, Blue = info. | Color + icon redundancy for accessibility. |
| **Acknowledgment Control** | Allows operator to acknowledge non-critical alerts. | Critical alerts may remain persistent until resolved. |
| **Actionable Insights** | Each alert includes cause summary and recommended action. | “Low QC – check alignment or signal flow.” |
| **Cross-Link to Log** | Alerts automatically log entries with source and timestamp. | Supports traceability and review. |

Alerts are non-blocking by design—operators can act immediately or defer acknowledgment based on priority.  
Some alerts (e.g., “Data quality too low to continue logging”) remain persistent until addressed.

---

### 6. Online Log Dock

Located along the bottom edge, the **Online Log Dock** provides immediate visibility into mission activity history.

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Auto-Logging** | Displays system-generated events and operator commands. | Scrollable list with time, event type, and message. |
| **Manual Note Entry** | Allows operators to record observations or annotations. | Opens inline input field; entry tagged with MissionID. |
| **Filtering & Search** | Filter by type (command, alert, note). | Instant filter applied within dock. |
| **Expand View** | Opens full Online Log in dedicated window. | Maintains mission context; scroll to detailed history. |

---

### 7. Modal Tools

The Mission Deck provides access to two key modal tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Behavior |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Diagnostics Modal** | Troubleshoot sensors, view signal flow, and run checks. | Opens centered overlay; context-bound to current mission. |
| **Configuration Manager Modal** | Review and edit active sensor or system configurations. | Displays configuration parameters and current status. |

> Both modals maintain active mission context and cannot alter other missions.  
> They can remain open during monitoring but are secondary to live controls.

---

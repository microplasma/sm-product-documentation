# 04.02_Mission_Deck

## Purpose
The **Mission Deck** is the central operational surface of the Survey Management Platform (SMP).  
It enables surveyors to manage live survey missions remotely—controlling sensors, supervising system and data health, monitoring file transfers, and responding to alerts in real time.

The Mission Deck integrates **Command & Control**, **Health and Quality Monitoring**, **Alert Management**, and **Traceability** into one synchronized interface.

---

## Scope & Context
The Mission Deck belongs to the **Mission Layer** of the SMP and operates within the currently active mission context.  
It is primarily used by **Survey Operators** and **Senior Surveyors** during live operations from an onshore control room.

Functions include:
- Starting/stopping data logging and controlling sensors.  
- Monitoring system and data quality.  
- Managing active alerts.  
- Tracking live file transfer status.  
- Reviewing recent mission logs.  
- Opening mission tools such as Diagnostics, Calibration, and Configuration Manager (read-only during logging).

All tools open in modals, maintaining mission context without leaving the main view.

## Key Concepts / Framework

| Dimension | Description | Role |
|------------|--------------|------|
| **Command & Execution** | Provides control over mission and sensors, including safe logging operations. | Operational control of live systems. |
| **Health & Quality Monitoring** | Displays live metrics for mission, sensor, and data health. | Early detection of performance degradation. |
| **Alert Awareness** | Highlights operational and quality alerts requiring attention. | Prevents unnoticed degradation or failure. |
| **Traceability** | Logs all state changes and operational actions automatically. | Enables auditability and accountability. |
| **File Transfer Status** | Provides ongoing visibility of recording and transfer continuity. | Ensures data integrity throughout operation. |

## Functional or UX Details

### 1. Layout Overview

| Zone | Purpose | Components |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Header** | Displays mission identity and access to key tools. | Mission ID, vessel, operator, UTC time, mission health, Tools bar (SVP/CDT, Calibration, Diagnostics, Config Manager). |
| **Left Panel – Command & Sensors** | Main mission and sensor controls. | Logging controls, sensor list with ON/OFF, Restart, Signal Flow buttons. |
| **Center Panel – Health & Quality** | Mission and sensor health visualization. | Metric tiles grouped by System, Sensor, and Data Integrity. |
| **Right Panel – Alerts** | Displays alerts by severity. | Alert Stack with color + icon redundancy. |
| **Bottom Dock – Online Log** | Shows recent mission events. | Auto-logged events, filter, and comment tools. |
| **Bottom-Right – File Transfer Monitor** | Displays file recording and transfer state. | File list, rates, and color-coded status tags. |

---

### 2. Command & Sensor Controls

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Start Logging** | Begins live recording of mission data. | Single-click initiation; triggers state change and visual feedback. |
| **Stop Logging** | Safely halts mission recording. | Confirmation required before stopping. |
| **Sensor ON/OFF** | Powers individual sensors up or down. | State reflected in Health & Quality panel. |
| **Restart Sensor** | Restarts sensor connection or process. | Shows transient progress state (e.g., border animation or “restarting” tag). |
| **Signal Flow** | Opens diagnostic modal for selected sensor. | Read-only during logging. |
| **Add Sensor (future)** | Placeholder for dynamic management. | Disabled in MVP. |

> All state-changing actions are automatically logged.  
> Only safe operations are permitted during live recording.  

---

### 3. Header & Tool Access

| Tool | Purpose | Behavior |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **SVP/CDT (Hydrosens)** | Opens water column profile tools (sound velocity/conductivity). | Opens modal; informational only during logging. |
| **Calibration** | Accesses calibration settings and routines. | Modal overlay; locked during logging. |
| **Diagnostics** | Opens network or sensor diagnostic interface. | Fully accessible; read-only logs during recording. |
| **Configuration Manager** | Provides access to configuration tabs: System, Sensors, Thresholds & Health, Templates. | - Read-only during active logging. <br> - Enables parameter edits and template application only when logging is stopped. <br> - Launches per-sensor diagnostics if available. |

> Tools open in modals that maintain mission context and close automatically when mission changes.  
> Access to Configuration Manager during logging is limited to inspection only.  

---

### 4. Health & Quality Monitoring

Metrics remain organized into three main groups:

| Group | Example Metrics | Representation | Source |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **System Health** | Network Latency, Clock Drift, Packet Loss, CPU Load | Horizontal bars with threshold coloring and icons. | Mission Engine |
| **Sensor Health** | Connectivity %, SNR, Ping Density, INS Drift, GNSS HDOP | Metric tiles with numeric + trend indicator. Temporary progress state shown during restart. | Sensor Telemetry |
| **Data Integrity & Environment** | File Rate, Recording State, SVP Validity | Compact summary tiles with bars and color coding. | Logging Subsystem |

> Metrics refresh continuously. Sensor reinitialization states are visually differentiated (e.g., animated or greyed tile).  

---

### 5. Alerts & Notifications

| Element | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Alert Stack** | Ordered list of mission alerts by severity. | Persistent and scrollable; non-blocking. |
| **Severity Encoding** | Red (Critical), Amber (Warning), Blue (Informational). | Combined color and icon encoding for accessibility. |
| **Acknowledgment** | Operator can acknowledge non-critical alerts. | Critical alerts remain visible until resolved. |
| **Actionable Insights** | Each alert includes brief cause and recommendation. | Example: “Packet loss detected – check network diagnostics.” |
| **Traceability** | Alerts generate corresponding log entries. | Ensures full operational audit trail. |

Some alerts (e.g., “Low QC – logging paused”) remain persistent until corrective action is taken.

---

### 6. Online Log Dock

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Auto-Logging** | Shows system and operator-generated events chronologically. | Real-time scroll with latest-first order. |
| **Add Note / Comment** | Allows manual annotations. | Inline entry; timestamped. |
| **Filter / Search** | Filters by event type or keyword. | Inline filter. |
| **Generate Handover** | Creates summary of mission activities. | Extracts entries for time window or event type. |

---

### 7. File Transfer Monitor

| Element | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **File Path & Name** | Displays active file path. | Updates automatically. |
| **Status Tags** | Reflect current recording phase (Recording, Validating, Transferring, Idle). | Color-coded and icon-supported. |
| **Transfer Rate** | Displays throughput in MB/s. | Animated numeric label. |

The panel remains visible at all times and provides passive assurance of continuous data flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Mission Deck provides full operational control of mission and sensors, with safeguards for active logging.  
- Configuration changes and template applications are **disabled during active logging** to prevent unsafe system modifications.  
- Health and Quality indicators reflect live system and sensor state.  
- Alerts are actionable, persistent where needed, and logged automatically.  
- File Transfer panel accurately displays recording and throughput status.  
- Header tool access maintains context via modals; read-only where appropriate.  
- Layout is responsive and maintains visual hierarchy and readability across resolutions.

## Open Questions & Next Steps

| Topic | Pending Decision |
|--------|------------------|
| **Sensor Restart Feedback** | Finalize visual feedback style for “in-progress” actions. |
| **Configuration Manager Lock State** | Confirm lock indicator or tooltip to communicate “read-only during logging.” |
| **File Transfer Controls** | Evaluate future need for retry or validation functions. |
| **Threshold Behavior** | Determine refresh logic for metric thresholds when applying templates post-logging. |
| **Cross-Linking Alerts** | Define if alerts can deep-link into specific tools (Diagnostics, Config Manager). |

---

### Summary Statement

> The **Mission Deck** centralizes mission control and awareness, combining real-time monitoring, command execution, and safe state management.  
> By restricting configuration during active logging and maintaining clear visual feedback, it ensures data integrity, operator confidence, and operational safety throughout remote survey missions.

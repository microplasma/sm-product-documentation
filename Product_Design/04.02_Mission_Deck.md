# 04.02_Mission_Deck

## Purpose
The **Mission Deck** is the primary operational workspace of the Survey Management Platform (SMP).  
It enables surveyors to manage live survey missions remotely by controlling sensors, executing mission-level actions, and monitoring system and data health in real time.

The Mission Deck integrates **Command & Control**, **Health and Quality Monitoring**, **Alert Management**, and **Traceability** within a single, mission-scoped view.

---

## Scope & Context
The Mission Deck belongs to the **Mission Layer** of SMP and operates within the currently active mission context.  
It is used primarily by **Survey Operators** and **Senior Surveyors** to supervise data acquisition and mission execution from an onshore control environment.

Functions include:
- Executing mission and sensor-level commands (start/stop logging, on/off, restart).  
- Monitoring health, performance, and data integrity.  
- Managing alerts and operational responses.  
- Tracking real-time file transfer status.  
- Reviewing recent mission events in the Online Log Dock.  
- Opening mission-specific tools (Diagnostics, Calibration, Config Manager).

Diagnostics and Configuration are accessed through **modals launched from the header**, preserving mission context and avoiding disruptive navigation.

## Key Concepts / Framework

### 1. Conceptual Overview

| Dimension | Description | Role |
|------------|--------------|------|
| **Command & Execution** | Provides direct mission and sensor control (logging, on/off, restart). | Operational control of live systems. |
| **Health & Quality Monitoring** | Displays aggregated and sensor-level health and quality metrics. | Early identification of performance degradation. |
| **Alert & Event Awareness** | Lists active alerts requiring operator attention. | Maintains situational awareness and drives corrective actions. |
| **Traceability & Logging** | Captures all operational actions and state changes. | Ensures transparency and operational accountability. |
| **File Transfer Status** | Displays data recording and transfer states for ongoing missions. | Confirms continuity of data flow. |

---

## Functional or UX Details

### 2. Layout Overview

| Zone | Purpose | Key Components |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Header** | Displays active mission identity and provides access to mission tools. | Mission ID, vessel, operator name, UTC time, system health status, tool buttons (SVP/CDT, Calibration, Diagnostics, Config Manager). |
| **Left Panel – Command & Sensors** | Core mission and sensor control area. | Logging controls, sensor list with on/off/restart, signal flow access. |
| **Center Panel – Health & Quality** | Aggregated view of mission and sensor health metrics. | Metric tiles grouped by System, Sensor, and Data Integrity. |
| **Right Panel – Alerts** | Displays current alerts ordered by severity. | Alert stack with color + icon indicators and acknowledgment options. |
| **Bottom Dock – Online Log** | Shows most recent log entries for the active mission. | Time, event, type, and quick annotation tools. |
| **Bottom-Right Panel – File Transfer** | Monitors live recording and file transmission states. | File name, status (Recording, Validating, Transferring, Idle), transfer rate. |

---

### 3. Command & Sensor Controls

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Start Logging** | Begins recording of live data streams. | Single action; progress feedback visible in File Transfer panel. |
| **Stop Logging** | Safely halts mission recording. | Confirmation required to prevent data loss. |
| **Sensor ON/OFF** | Enables or disables individual sensors. | Status updates immediately reflected in Health & Quality. |
| **Restart Sensor** | Power-cycles sensor connection or process. | Triggers transient progress indication (e.g., animated border or temporary state). |
| **Signal Flow** | Opens sensor-specific diagnostics modal. | Provides sensor communication and signal status details. |
| **Add Sensor (future)** | Placeholder for dynamic sensor management. | Disabled in MVP. |

> All commands produce immediate visual feedback in the interface.  
> Only state-changing actions (e.g., logging, sensor power) generate entries in the mission log.

---

### 4. Header & Tool Access

The Mission Deck header provides **mission identity, operator context, and direct tool access**.

| Tool | Purpose | Behavior |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **SVP/CDT (Hydrosens)** | Launches sound velocity profile or conductivity test tool. | Opens modal window within mission context. |
| **Calibration** | Opens calibration management view. | Modal overlay; non-disruptive to monitoring. |
| **Diagnostics** | Accesses diagnostic functions for network or signal flow tests. | Modal overlay; displays mission-specific diagnostics. |
| **Configuration Manager** | Opens configuration templates and sensor parameter review. | Modal view; modifications logged if applied. |

> Tool launches are **not logged** unless a change or command is issued.  
> All modals are mission-scoped and automatically close when mission context changes.

---

### 5. Health & Quality Monitoring

Health and Quality are organized into three major groups, providing both overview and sensor-level feedback.

| Group | Example Metrics | Representation | Source |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **System Health** | Network Latency, Clock Drift, Packet Loss, CPU Load | Bar or gauge indicators with thresholds (color + icon redundancy). | Mission Engine |
| **Sensor Health** | Connection %, SNR, Ping Density, INS Drift, GNSS HDOP | Numeric or bar tiles with trend arrows. Temporary “in-progress” state shown when restarting or reconnecting. | Sensor Telemetry |
| **Data Integrity & Environment** | File Rate, Recording Status, SVP Validity | Compact progress bars and summary text. | Logging / Transfer Subsystem |

Metrics update continuously.  
Color and iconography provide redundancy for accessibility.  
Transient sensor actions (restart, reconnect) trigger short-lived **progress indications** rather than fixed alerts.

---

### 6. Alerts & Notifications

| Element | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Alert Stack** | Persistent list of current mission alerts. | Right-aligned vertical stack; highest severity on top. |
| **Severity Encoding** | Red = Critical, Amber = Warning, Blue = Informational (all paired with icons). | Accessible via both color and shape cues. |
| **Acknowledgment Control** | Allows acknowledgment of non-critical alerts. | Critical alerts remain active until resolved. |
| **Actionable Context** | Each alert includes a brief cause and recommended next step. | “Low ping density – verify navigation offset.” |
| **Traceability Link** | Each alert creates a log entry with timestamp and source. | Enables event correlation post-mission. |

Alerts are **non-blocking**, ensuring continuous operation unless mission safety requires attention.

---

### 7. Online Log Dock

| Function | Description | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Auto-Logging** | Displays recent commands, alerts, and events chronologically. | Scrollable, real-time updates. |
| **Add Note / Comment** | Allows operators to add free-form annotations. | Tagged with MissionID and timestamp. |
| **Filter / Search** | Filters by type or keyword. | Quick filtering, inline results. |
| **Generate Handover** | Prepares summary of recent activity for shift transition. | Extracts entries within selected time range. |

---

### 8. File Transfer Monitor

The File Transfer panel (bottom-right) provides **real-time visibility** into data flow and recording integrity.

| Element | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **File Path & Name** | Displays current file being written. | Updated dynamically. |
| **Status Tags** | Show operational state (Recording, Validating, Transferring, Idle). | Color-coded labels; accessible via icons. |
| **Transfer Rate** | Displays current throughput (MB/s). | Numeric with subtle animation. |

> The panel is **persistent** during mission monitoring and serves as a passive confirmation of data continuity.  
> No direct user interaction is planned for MVP.

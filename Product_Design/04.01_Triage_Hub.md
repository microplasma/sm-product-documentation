# 04.01_Triage_Hub

## Purpose
The **Triage Hub** is the entry point and global overview of the Survey Management Platform (SMP).  
It allows surveyors operating from onshore facilities to view all missions assigned to them, assess mission health at a glance, and select which mission to actively monitor and control.

The Triage Hub supports **multi-mission awareness**, **safe activation of mission contexts**, and **immediate visibility into system health**, forming the foundation of the platform’s command and control environment.

---

## Scope & Context
The Triage Hub exists within the **Global Layer** of the SMP, meaning it operates **outside any single mission context**.  
Its purpose is to:
- Display an overview of all missions under a surveyor’s responsibility.  
- Summarize health, performance, and alert states across missions.  
- Allow activation or switching of the current mission context.  
- Provide immediate awareness of degraded or critical mission conditions.

When a mission is activated from the Triage Hub, all mission-scoped windows (Mission Deck, Stream Viewer, Navigation) update to that mission’s context.

---

## Key Concepts / Framework

### 1. Conceptual Overview

The Triage Hub acts as a **command launcher and situational dashboard**.  
It is not intended for detailed monitoring, but for quick, informed decision-making about **where to focus operational attention**.

Core design intent:
- Keep the display lightweight and scannable.  
- Emphasize **relative mission health**, not raw telemetry.  
- Allow safe activation of mission context without interrupting active processes.  
- Surface alerts that may require switching focus.

## Functional or UX Details

### 2. Layout Overview

| Zone | Purpose | Example Components |
|-------|----------|--------------------|
| **Global Header** | Provides global context independent of missions. | SMP logo, operator name, UTC clock, system connection status. |
| **Mission List Grid** | Displays mission cards/containers summarizing each mission’s status. | Mission title, ID, vessel name, health summary, alert badges. |
| **Filter & Search Bar** | Allows quick access when managing many missions. | Text search, status filters (Active, Idle, Critical). |
| **Action Bar / Footer** | Contains mission activation button and global actions. | “Activate Mission,” “View Logs,” “Refresh.” |

---

### 3. Mission Card Structure

Each **Mission Card** acts as an interactive summary element that conveys the state of a mission at a glance.

| Element | Description | Representation |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Mission Name / ID** | Unique mission identifier. | Text with mission icon. |
| **Vessel / Location Info** | Provides context about where the mission is running. | Small vessel name + geographic tag. |
| **Health Indicator** | Aggregated mission health based on latency, drift, and packet loss. | Color + icon (✓ = normal, ! = warning, ⚠ = critical). |
| **Quality Indicator** | Represents data integrity and QC metrics from Stream Viewer. | Bar or dial visualization with numeric score (0–100). |
| **Active Status** | Highlights the currently selected mission. | Active border or color accent. |
| **Alert Badge** | Displays count of unresolved alerts for that mission. | Number badge with severity color. |
| **Last Update Timestamp** | Shows last received telemetry or heartbeat. | UTC time text. |

The cards are designed for **rapid scanning**, allowing operators to identify degraded missions within seconds.

---

### 4. Key Functions & Interactions

| Function | Description | Outcome |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Mission Activation** | Select and confirm which mission to make active. | Updates context across all mission-scoped windows. |
| **Mission Health Overview** | View summarized health (system + data). | Helps prioritize which mission requires focus. |
| **Alert Awareness** | Identify active alerts per mission. | Encourages proactive response before failure. |
| **Filtering / Sorting** | Organize missions by name, status, or alert severity. | Increases situational clarity when handling multiple missions. |
| **Quick Log Access** | Open mission-specific log summary (read-only) without activating mission. | Enables quick context check before activation. |

> All interactions are **non-destructive** — activating or inspecting a mission never interferes with running operations.

---

### 5. Health and Quality Metrics Displayed

The Triage Hub aggregates **mission-level summaries**, not individual sensor metrics.  
These summaries are derived from Mission Deck and Stream Viewer data.

| Metric Group | Example Metrics | Source | Representation |
|---------------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| **System Health** | Latency, Packet Loss, CPU Load | Mission Deck | Horizontal bars + color/icon indicator |
| **Sensor Performance** | SNR, Ping Density, INS Drift | Stream Viewer | Compact numeric trend indicator |
| **Data Integrity** | File Write Rate, QC Score | Mission Deck / Stream Viewer | Numeric score + progress bar |
| **Alert Count** | Active and Critical Alerts | Mission Deck / Online Log | Badge with count |
| **Last Sync** | Time since last telemetry update | System Engine | Text (“5s ago”, “Offline”) |

> Each metric provides a **relative snapshot**—the surveyor should only switch missions if a degradation warrants focused investigation.

---

### 6. Mission Activation Workflow

1. **Select Mission Card** – Operator clicks on a mission card.  
2. **Confirm Activation** – Quick modal displays current vs. selected mission for confirmation.  
3. **Context Broadcast** – The SMP sets the selected mission as active and updates:  
   - Mission Deck  
   - Stream Viewer(s)  
   - Navigation display  
4. **State Feedback** – Header updates with mission name and timestamp; log entry automatically recorded.  

This workflow ensures that **mission activation is intentional, logged, and traceable**.

---

### 7. Visual Hierarchy & Behavior

- **Color + Icon Redundancy:** Used to convey status clearly even under poor lighting or color vision limitations.  
- **Adaptive Layout:** Mission cards reflow based on available screen real estate (2–3 columns typical).  
- **Focus Retention:** Once a mission is active, its card remains visually distinguished from others.  
- **Alert Escalation:** Critical alerts pulse or animate subtly until acknowledged via the Mission Deck.  
- **Non-Blocking Behavior:** Triage Hub can be left open during operation for monitoring passive missions.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Triage Hub enables operators to view and manage multiple missions safely from a single overview screen.  
- Health and quality indicators accurately summarize mission states without overloading the operator.  
- Activation and confirmation flows prevent accidental mission switches.  
- Alerts, health, and data quality are communicated through redundant visual cues (color + icon).  
- Layout scales across different resolutions and remains readable at distance.

---

## Open Questions & Next Steps

| Topic | Pending Decision |
|--------|------------------|
| **Mission Grouping** | Should missions be grouped by vessel, project, or region? |
| **Alert Propagation Rules** | Define when a Triage alert should trigger global visual escalation. |
| **Offline Mission Handling** | Confirm how inactive or paused missions appear in the overview. |
| **Performance Updates** | Determine update cadence for mission health summaries (live or periodic). |

---

### Summary Statement

> The **Triage Hub** provides the surveyor with a clear, actionable overview of all assigned missions.  
> It prioritizes awareness, safety, and clarity—allowing the operator to identify degraded missions quickly and activate the correct context without disrupting other ongoing operations.
